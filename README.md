This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Libraries
- [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for css styling
- [antd](https://ant.design/) for layout components
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form handling
- yup for validations

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing Proposal

Front-End Engineer Tech Exercise: Building a WMS API with React and Server-Side Rendering

Objective:

The goal of this exercise is to assess a candidate's ability to
implement a small set of JSON-API endpoints for creating and retrieving
products and orders, simulating a Warehouse Management System (WMS).
The implementation should use React for the front-end and include
server-side rendering.

Instructions:

Understanding the API:

Familiarize yourself with the API documentation: WMS API Documentation.
Pay close attention to the endpoints related to products and orders.
React Application Setup:

Set up a new React application using Create React App or your preferred
boilerplate.
Configure server-side rendering using a suitable technology or library
(e.g., Next.js).

API Integration:

Implement the necessary components and logic to interact with the
provided JSON-API endpoints.
Create React components for displaying and managing products and
orders.
Implement functionality for creating and retrieving products and orders
based on the API documentation.

User Interface:

Design a simple and user-friendly interface to showcase the products
and orders.
Include features such as product listing, order creation, and order
details display.

Server-Side Rendering:

Ensure that your React application is set up for server-side rendering.
Leverage the benefits of server-side rendering for improved
performance.

Error Handling:

Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms for API requests.
Provide informative error messages to the user in case of failures.
Testing:

Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of your components.
Test the API integration to handle different scenarios (success, error,
loading states).

Documentation:

Document your code to make it clear and understandable.
Provide a brief README.md explaining how to run the application locally
and any other relevant information.

Submission:

Push your code to a version control system (e.g., GitHub) and share the
repository link.
Include instructions on how to set up and run the application.

Evaluation Criteria:

Adherence to API specifications.
Quality of React components and overall architecture.
Proper implementation of server-side rendering.
Handling of error scenarios and user feedback.
Code cleanliness, organization, and documentation.
Thoughtful design and usability of the user interface.

Note: Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools that you find
appropriate for this exercise. The primary focus is on demonstrating
your understanding of React, API integration, and server-side
rendering.
